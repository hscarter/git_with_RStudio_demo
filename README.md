# git_with_RStudio_demo
A repository for the RStudio Git workshop with NUIT RCDS taught by Tobin. 

When you create a new R project, you can chose version control directory and clone from github with the http address. 

Within RStudio in the environment panel there is a Git tab where you can commit, stage, pull, push, and ignore things.
